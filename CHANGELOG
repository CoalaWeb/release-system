Version 0.2 (Current trunk)
================================================================================
!! HACK: The frontent/views/update/tmpl/stream.php FORCES the type to be "component". I have to deal with that.
# Notice thrown in Control Panel due to missing entry (today's downloads)
# Authentication against a Download ID wouldn't work
# No view except the Control Panel would load in Joomla! 1.6 RC1 or later
# Tokens were missing throughout the application
# Text filters were not escaped (potential XSS attack vector)
# Year statistics do not take the year into account (2011 stats show 2010 downloads)
# The currently selected file doesn't appear on copied entries with a type of File
# Files already used in other releases of the same category would appear when editing or creating an item
# Using the Download Log filters would cause a terrible lag when having several hundred thousands of log items in the database table

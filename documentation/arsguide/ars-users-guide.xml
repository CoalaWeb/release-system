        <title>Introducing <application>Akeeba Release
        System</application></title>

        <para>Akeeba Release System (or ARS for short) is a download manager
        component quite different than its competition. It is primarily geared
        towards developers who want to disseminate their software products to
        their clients, but can also be used as a generic downloads manager.
        Its key features are:</para>

        <para>Installing <application>Akeeba Release System</application> is
        no different than installing any other <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
        extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for

        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">official help page</link>.
        Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with these
        instructions and we will not duplicate them.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Getting the installation packages</title>

          <para>You can download the latest installation packages by visiting
          our site at <link xlink:href="http://www.akeebabackup.com"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.akeebabackup.com</link>.
          Just click on the Download, Official Releases menu item on the top
          menu of our site. Then click on Akeeba Release System. The releases
          are listed with the newest release always on top, using ARS itself
          to present them! Click on it to view the files. Click on the "Akeeba
          Release System" item to download the ZIP installation
          package.</para>

          <note>
            <para>Do not forget to download the documentation PDF file or read
            it online. As we do not provide support free of charge this is
            your best bet in solving your problems if you do not have a
            SUPPORT or AKEEBAPRO subscription.</para>
          </note>

          <para>The installation package can be installed on both Joomla! 1.5
          and Joomla! 1.6 sites. It can also be used to upgrade Akeeba Release
          System; just install it <emphasis>without</emphasis> uninstalling
          the previous release.</para>

          <para>In any case, do not extract the ZIP files yet!</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Installing the component</title>

          <para>Log in to your site's administrator section. Click on the
          <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
          <guimenuitem>Install/Uninstall</guimenuitem> (Joomla! 1.5) or
          <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
          (Joomla! 1.6 users) link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
          <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button in the <guilabel>Upload Package
          File</guilabel> area. Locate the installation ZIP file you had
          previously downloaded and select it. Back to the page, click on the
          <guibutton>Upload File &amp; Install</guibutton> button. After a
          short while, <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> will tell you that the
          component has been installed.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Manual installation</title>

            <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to
            properly extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your
            server. In this case, you can follow a manual installation
            procedure.</para>

            <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
            subdirectory named <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC.
            Then, upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary
            directory. At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
            <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
            which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

            <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
            located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
            Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the
            <guilabel>Server</guilabel> tab and take a look at the
            <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel> setting. The default
            setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory under your
            site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations using
            Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
            <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult
            your host for instructions on how to upload files inside this
            directory, or about changing your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
            temporary directory back to the default location and making it
            writable.</para>

            <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on the
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
            <guimenuitem>Install/Uninstall</guimenuitem> (Joomla! 1.5) or
            <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
            (Joomla! 1.6 users) link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
            <guibutton>Install Directory</guibutton> edit box in the
            <guilabel>Install from Directory</guilabel> area. It is already
            filled in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for
            example <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
            <filename>/akeeba</filename> to it. As per our example, it should
            look something like
            <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp/akeeba</filename>. Then, click on
            the <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.</para>

            <para>If you still can't install Akeeba Release System and you are
            receiving messages regarding unwritable directories, inability to
            move files or other similar file system related error messages,
            please do not ask us for support. These errors stem from your site
            set up and can best be resolved by asking for help in the <link
            xlink:href="http://forum.joomla.org"

        <title>Updating to the latest version</title>

        <bridgehead>Checking for the latest version and upgrading</bridgehead>

        <para>You can easily check for the latest published version of the ARS
        component by visiting <link os=""
        xlink:href="http://www.akeebabackup.com/latest"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.akeebabackup.com/latest</link>.
        The page lists the version and release date of the latest ARS release.
        You can check it against the data which appear on the bottom of your
        ARS Control Panel. If your release is out of date, simply click on the
        Download link to download the install package of the latest release to
        your PC.</para>

        <para>Updating <application>ARS</application> to the latest version is
        by no means different than installing the component. You do not have
        to uninstall the previous version; in fact, you are discouraged from
        doing so. Simply follow the installation instructions so as to install
        the latest <application>A</application>RS version over the existing
        <application>ARS</application> installation. That's all! All your
        settings are preserved.</para>

        <bridgehead>Live update</bridgehead>

        <para>There is also an alternate update path, if your server supports
        it. It is called the "Live Update" feature. Whenever you visit the ARS
        Control Panel, it will automatically check for the existence of an
        updated version and it will notify you. You can see the notification
        button on the bottom of the left-hand section of the Control Panel
        page. Clicking on the notification allows you to perform a live update
        without further interaction. Do note that if your server is protected
        by a firewall you'll have to enable port 80 and 443 TCP traffic to
        www.akeebabackup.com and joomlacode.org for this feature to work
        properly.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="using-the-backend">
      <title>Using the back-end</title>

      <para>The bulk of ARS is in its back-end. This is where you will be
      setting up your repositories, update streams, view your log files,
      upload files and more. Since you are going to spend most of your time
      looking at the back-end, we have done our best to streamline your
      administrative experience. Our goal is to have you spend as little time
      as humanly possible while publishing files. Your time is better spent
      creating the files, be it code, documentation, your dissertation, your
      weekly e-magazine or anything which can be downloaded.</para>

      <section xml:id="the-structure-of-a-repo">
        <title>Understanding the structure of a repository</title>

        <para>Akeeba Release System is designed as a dual-repository,
        three-level system. Quite fancy wording and I'm sure you didn't
        understand anything. Let's break it down and understand how an ARS
        repository is structured.</para>

        <para>The repository is logically separated to two sub-repositories.
        By default, they are named "Official Releases" and "Development
        Releases". Their only difference is the way items are added to them.
        In "Official Releases" you have to manually go to the back-end, enter
        an existing "category", create a new "release" and start uploading
        "items" to it, then publish the lot for your site visitors to see and
        download. In "Development Releases" you do not have to use your site's
        back-end. All you need to do is to use FTP to create a new directory,
        which automatically creates and publishes a new "release", and upload
        files, which automatically creates and publishes a new "item". The
        separation is only logical. If you wish to do so, you can display both
        sub-repositories as a single repository.</para>

        <para>The repository follows the standard convention of Joomla! 1.0
        and 1.5 article categorization. Each repository can have one or more
        "categories". Each category can have one or more "releases". Each
        release can have one or more "items". The "categories" are the top
        organization level of your data. Usually you have to create one
        category per software you want to publish. If you are not interested
        in publishing software, create one category per general file type.
        Think of them as article Sections.</para>

        <para>Each category has one more "releases". Think of a release as a
        group of files belonging to the same chronological order. Each release
        is supposed to supersede the directly previous release (the one with a
        higher ordering number than itself).</para>

        <para>Finally, "items" are what your visitors download. We chose to
        name them "items" instead of "files" because they can either be
        physical files stored on your server or links to a remote resource
        served from a different web server.</para>

        <bridgehead>Practical example: Software distribution</bridgehead>

        <para>This is the kind of repositories ARS excels at. Create one
        category per software you want to publish. Let's say you produce an
        application named "Kitten Finder" and a Joomla! component named
        "Kitten.me". Each one of them is a category in ARS. Create one release
        per version of the software. For instance, "Kitten Finder" has
        released versions 1.0.b1 (a beta release) and 1.0 stable. Each one of
        the versions is a release in ARS. Each downloadable file is an ARS
        item. For example, you may have an installer of Kitten Finder for
        Windows, another for Linux, a third one for Mac OS X, a PDF with
        instructions and so on. Each file belonging to specific version of the
        application is an item in ARS.</para>

        <para>In order to allow your visitors to browse the entirety of your
        repository, you will have to create a menu item to the full
        repository.</para>

        <bridgehead>Practical example: Community site</bridgehead>

        <para>In this case, you will be using ARS as a generic download
        system, much like DOCman or PhocaDownloads. Do the following mind
        mapping:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Section - ARS Category</para>

        <para>Now, let's say you want to publish your weekly newsletter in PDF
        format. Create an ARS category item named "Newsletter". For each new
        issue, create an ARS release named after the date of publication, e.g.
        "January 2011", "February 2011" and so on inside the "Newsletter"
        category. Finally, create a single ARS item per issue so that your
        visitors can download the PDF file of your newsletter.</para>

        <para>In order to reduce the number of clicks required by your
        visitors to get to the desired download, just create a menu item to
        the specific Category you created. There's no need to create a link to
        the full repository.</para>

        <bridgehead>Practical example: A personal site / blog</bridgehead>

        <para>This is the most peculiar download repository setup. Usually,
        such users only need to publish a bunch of files and track download
        stats. The easy way to do that is to create an ARS category (the name
        is indifferent), an ARS release under it (use something descriptive of
        your site) and just publish items in that single release. In order to
        save your visitors some clicks, you can create a menu item directly to
        this sole release, so that nothing but your files gets listed.</para>

          <para>You can quickly make a copy of a category by selecting its

          a category by selecting it and clicking on the

          items associated with that category. Beware! You will not be asked
          to confirm this choice. Deleting a category is an irreversible
          change. If you are not sure, unpublish instead of removing the
          category. You can edit a category either by clicking on its name in
          the list, or selecting it and clicking on the
          <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> button. You can add one or more new

                even a web page by its URL. You can use it to let your
                visitors download files hosted on external sites (e.g. your
                friend's site, JoomlaCode.org, SourceForge, Amazon S3,
                DropBox, Windows Live SkyDrive, RapidShare, MegaUpload etc) or
                redirect visitors to an external page. Using the Link type
                will not reveal the URL of the external item to your visitors
                until they proceed with downloading the item. Furthermore, all
                download links are marked as no-follow and no-index, so that
                search engines do not reveal the URL to the linked
                file/page.</para>

        <section xml:id="uploading-files">
          <title>Uploading and managing files</title>

          <para>ARS comes with an integrated system to handle file uploads,
          manage files and create sub-directories. It is accessible from ARS
          Control Panel page by clicking on the <guibutton>Upload and Manage
          Files</guibutton> button.</para>

          <para>When you launch that feature, it asks you to select a
          category. Select a category from the drop-down. This step is
          required for ARS to know which directory it should operate on.
          Remember that each category is linked with one Files Directory. Upon
          selecting a category, the page reloads with the full
          interface.</para>

          <para>Right below the category selection area you will find two
          panes. The left hand pane contains a list of folders. You can create
          a new folder by typing a name in the box and clicking on the
          <guibutton>New folder</guibutton> button. Do note that the Joomla!
          API will convert dots and spaces to underscores and turn everything
          to lowercase characters. You can click on any directory to go
          "inside" it. The right hand pane contains a list of file. The name
          and size of each file is displayed. Click on the trashcan icon to
          delete the file.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>ARS will not check if the file you delete belongs to an
            active item. It is perfectly possible that you end up deleting a
            file used by an active item, causing problems to users who try to
            download that item.</para>
          </warning>

          <para>The bottom part of the page is the upload form. It uses
          Joomla!'s upload feature. Do note that your file will be uploaded to
          the the directory you are currently viewing.</para>

          <title>JoomlaCode.org integration</title>

          <para>Having primarily developers of free Joomla! extensions in
          mind, we are providing an integration with JoomlaCode.org, the
          official project and file hosting facility of the Joomla! project.
          The idea is that if you produce free Joomla! software you most
          likely want JoomlaCode.org to host your downloads (free bandwidth!)
          and you don't really fancy having to manually copy links from
          JoomlaCode.org to ARS. We have semi-automated this procedure for
          you.</para>

          <para>Start by clicking on the <guibutton>Import from JoomlaCode
          FRS</guibutton> button in ARS Control Panel page. In the new page,
          you will have to select an ARS release where you want to import the
          file links into. Select it from the drop-down.</para>

          <para>In the <guilabel>JoomlaCode project tag</guilabel> text box
          enter the shorthand name of your project in JoomlaCode.org. If you
          are not sure, you can find that out from your JoomlaCode.org URL.
          Visit your project's page and you'll see a URL in your address bar
          similar to <uri>http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/example</uri>. That
          last part of the URL (i.e. <uri>example</uri>) is what you need to
          type in the JoomlaCode project tag text box in ARS. Then press the
          Tab key or click on <guibutton>Get packages</guibutton>.</para>

          <para>A list of JoomlaCode packages appears below. Select the
          package which holds your releases in the <guilabel>Select

          <guibutton>Get Releases</guibutton>.</para>

          <para>A list of JoomlaCode releases appears below. Select the
          release which holds your files in the <guilabel>Select

          <guibutton>Get Files</guibutton>.</para>

          <para>A list of files appears below. Click on each file to create a
          new item linking to it in the selected ARS release. All items are
          unpublished by default. When you are done importing files from
          JoomlaCode, simply click on the Items link just below the toolbar to
          get back to the ARS Items page where you can publish your
          files.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>If you are using the Automatic Descriptions feature, the
            name of the item, its description and all of its fields will be

        <title>Advanced: update streams, automatic descriptions, Amazon
        S3</title>

        <para>One of the most distinctive features of ARS is that it is
        designed with software delivery in mind. Two of the most common
        problems in that arena is providing updates to your clients and having
        to type in the same descriptions over and over again. ARS solves both
        problems. It can automatically produce update streams in a generic and
        reusable INI format, or automatically produce Joomla! 1.6 XML update
        streams for use with any Joomla! 1.6 extension. Then, instead of
        having to manually type in the title and description of files, you can
        set up automatic descriptions so that ARS can type in this information
        for you.</para>

        <section xml:id="update-streams">
          <title>Setting up update streams</title>

          <para>ARS comes with integrated update stream provisioning. Update
          streams are, in short, a machine-readable representation of your
          repository. They can be used by remote clients to figure out if
          there is an update available and optionally ask the user to download
          it and install it. ARS can serve two types of update streams:</para>

          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>INI format</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>This is a custom format, designed with portability in
                mind. The update information is rendered as a standard INI
                format text file. The downside of this format is that only the
                latest version is displayed in the stream.</para>

            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>

              <listitem>
                <para>Joomla! 1.6 and later comes with an extension update
                manager. In order for it to work, it requires developers to
                supply update information in a custom XML format. There are
                actually three type of XML files Joomla! 1.6 and later
                understands. The "extensionset" document serves as the master
                update stream. It contains links to one or more repositories,
                one for each extension type Joomla! 1.6 and later understands,
                i.e. components, plugins, modules, libraries, packages,
                templates and files. The second form of an "extensionset"
                document is the master index of extensions of a specific type
                (called "category") known to this server, e.g. a list of
                components. Each item on that list points to an "updates" XML
                document. This third and final XML format contains the history
                of an extension. It tells us the version history, details
                about the extension, links to an information page and, most
                importantly, tells us where to download the extension
                from.</para>

                <para>This is an overly complex system and maintaining such
                files manually can be a drag. ARS handles all three types of
                documents for you, automatically. In order to add updates
                support to your Joomla! 1.6 and later extension, all you have
                to do is to add the following lines just before the closing
                &lt;/install&gt; tag in your extension's manifest XML
                file:</para>

                <programlisting>&lt;updateservers&gt;
    &lt;server type="extension" priority="1"
        name="<replaceable>Whatever you want to call it</replaceable>"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[<replaceable>link_to_your_update_stream_xml</replaceable>]]&gt;&lt;/server&gt;
&lt;/updateservers&gt;
</programlisting>

                <para>The name attribute can be anything you want. Usually it
                should be something like "<replaceable>Name Of
                Extension</replaceable> Updates", e.g. "Akeeba Backup Core
                Updates". The link in the CDATA section is the XML link
                provided by ARS.</para>

                <important>
                  <para>Since Joomla! 1.7.0, you URL must end with
                  <filename>.xml</filename> for Joomla! to be able to use it.
                  This means that the long, non-SEF form of the URL, e.g.
                  <uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_ars&amp;view=update&amp;task=stream&amp;format=xml&amp;id=1</uri>
                  mentioned in the XML link on the <guilabel>Update
                  Streams</guilabel> page will not work. Just append
                  <uri>&amp;dummy=extension.xml</uri> to it and it will work,
                  e.g.
                  <uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_ars&amp;view=update&amp;task=stream&amp;format=xml&amp;id=1&amp;dummy=extension.xml</uri>
                  for the example above. ARS will do that automatically for
                  you when generating the Master Joomla! XML Update
                  stream.</para>
                </important>

                <warning>
                  <para>You MUST NOT leave a space or put a newline between
                  the server open/close tag and its contents. Anything between
                  those tags, including newlines and spaces, are considered
                  part of the update URL and will cause problems with
                  Joomla!'s integrated update system.</para>
                </warning>

                <note>
                  <para>When using the master XML stream, not the extension's

          <para>On the very top of the page you will find a link to your

          <para>The grid below is a standard Joomla! administrator table.
          Clicking on a stream name allows you to edit it. The most important
          column is the <guilabel>Links</guilabel> column. It provides direct
          links to the publicly accessible formats of your update stream. The
          INI link will take you to the INI format update stream, which is
          necessary for Live Update to work. More information on including
          Live Update in your components can be found in a later section of
          this documentation. The XML link will take you to the Joomla! 1.6
          and later XML "update" document for that stream. This is the XML
          file you should in extension manifest files, inside the CDATA

          <para>Editing or adding an update stream will present you with an

                <para>An update stream looks for files following a specific
                naming convention. You have to supply a "shell pattern" in
                here. This is fancy wording for saying that you provide a
                filename and use a single question mark (?) to match any
                single character or a single start (*) to match any number of
                characters. It's what you already use on your operating
                system! Only items whose File or URL field matches this
                pattern will be included in the update stream.</para>

                <para>For instance, all Akeeba Backup Core installation
                packages are named com_akeeba-VERSIONNUMBER-core.zip, where

                com_akeeba-3.1.5-core.zip etc. This leads us to a naming
                pattern of <filename>com_akeeba-*-core.zip</filename> and
                that's what I would use.</para>

                "Backend". For plugins, modules and templates select

          <section>
            <title>The INI update format</title>

            <para>The INI update format was designed with portability in mind.
            It is a deliberately simple format so that it can be parsed by
            PHP, as well as a plethora of programming languages such as Ruby,
            Python, Delphi, Pascal, C/C++, C#, VB.NET, or even Visual Basic
            for Applications (if you consider <emphasis>that</emphasis> a
            programming language!). A typical stream looks like this:</para>

            <programlisting>; Live Update provision file
software="Foo Bar"
version="1.2.3"
link="http://www.example.com/downloads/foobar-1.2.3.zip.html"
date="2010-10-10"</programlisting>

            <para>The first line is a comment and is always there. It allow
            you to figure out if the rest of the file is a valid INI update
            stream.</para>

            <para>The software key provide the name of the software item. The
            version key provides the latest version published. The link key
            provides a download link to the item linked to that update stream.
            Do note that due to Joomla!'s routing the extension of the file
            might always be .html! <emphasis role="bold">Do not</emphasis>
            trust the extension to tell you about the file type. When you
            initiate the download, ARS will set the correct MIME type in the
            HTTP headers. You should trust that header instead to figure out
            the real file type. Finally, the date key gives you the release
            date of the latest version in YYYY-MM-DD format.</para>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="automatic-descriptions">
          <title>Automatic item descriptions</title>

          <para>Most often than not, when dealing with software distribution,
          you need to provide the same description and title to similarly
          named files. For example, if you have an installable package of your
          software you may want to give short installation instructions and a
          link to the thorough installation guide in its description. Most
          likely, it will also have a standard title, e.g. "com_foobar for
          Joomla! 1.5". Traditionally, this is dealt with by copying the
          release items from one release to the next. However, this is the
          least convenient way to do it, as you have to copy items, edit them
          one by one and change the file or URL they point to. That takes
          time. What's better is to have your download system somehow "know"
          the title and description of each download item. This is even more
          important with zero-click item publishing like what ARS does with
          its BleedingEdge-type repositories. So, ARS does exactly that: it
          knows the title and description of any file, with its Automatic Item
          Descriptions feature.</para>

          <para>Launch this feature by using the <guibutton>Automatic Item
          Descriptions</guibutton> button in ARS Control Panel. You are
          presented with a standard Joomla! administration table. Editing an

          fields:</para>

          <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>Category</term>

              <listitem>

                <para>The file naming pattern of the files which will be
                handled by this automatic description. For example, if you
                type in <filename>com_foobar-*.zip</filename> all items whose
                File or URL field matches this pattern (e.g.
                com_foobar-1.0.zip, com_foobar-extras-1.0.zip) will be
                assigned the Title and Description provided below if these

          <para>Akeeba Release System fully support Amazon S3 for storing your
          download items and serving them directly from there. It also
          supports Bleeding Edge categories hosted on Amazon S3.</para>

          <para>We chose to integrate Amazon S3 with ARS because it is the
          most reputable and very low cost cloud storage provider. Using S3 to
          store your download items instead of your server's filesystem means
          that you don't consume your server's bandwidth with your downloads.
          Instead, everything is diverted to S3 where bandwidth is generally
          much cheaper than what hosting providers offer. Moreover, your files
          are always privately stored and can not be accessed by unauthorised
          users, even if they successfully guess the correct path to the
          files, something which is much harder to implement on a regular web

                can be thought of as a virtual drive living in Amazon's cloud
                where you can store files in. In order to manage your Amazon

                The list of bucket names appears on the left hand side. If you

                <guibutton>Create</guibutton> button to create one.</para>

                <para>Click on the bucket you want to use with ARS. It becomes
                selected and the right-hand pane loads a list of its contents.
                Above the right-hand pane there is a toolbar. Click on the
                <guilabel>Properties</guilabel> button. A bottom pane opens.
                On the let-hand side, you will see the

                <important>
                  <para>Bucket names are case sensitive! This means that ABC,

              <term>Timeout for authenticated URLs</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>Since ARS is designed to work with files stored on
                Amazon S3 as "Private", there would be an issue: how could we
                serve those files to the site's visitors? One way would be to
                download the file to your server, then serve it like the other
                file downloads. This would make the downloads dead slow!
                Instead, we use what Amazon calls "authenticated URLs". An
                authenticated URL is a specially crafted URL which allows
                anyone knowing it to access and download the private file it
                references for a limited amount of time. So, ARS creates an
                authenticated URL and redirects the user's browser to it when
                he asks to download the file.</para>

                <para>This ARS configuration option determines for how long
                the authenticated URL will be valid. By default, this is 1
                minute, which is more than ample time to initiate the
                download. However, if your client is using a download manager
                and schedules the download for a later time, the URL will have
                expired before the download manager tries to access it,
                causing the download to fail. If you get grumpy users
                complaining that your downloads don't work, you can increase
                this timeout. We consider that anything over one day is an
                overkill, but it's your option to set it to as high as you
                want, up to a full month.</para>

          <bridgehead>Creating categories linked to S3</bridgehead>

          <para>Any ARS category can be instructed to look inside your
          configured S3 bucket instead of your server's filesystem. In the
          <guilabel>Files Directory</guilabel> option of the category you have
          to enter something like <filename>s3://mydirectory</filename> where
          mydirectory is the name of a directory in your S3 bucket. If you
          want to use your bucket's root for this category (not recommended!)
          you can simply enter <filename>s3://</filename> in this
          field.</para>

          <para>From that point, all file operations are performed against the
          S3 bucket instead of your server's filesystem. In fact, you can use
          the <guibutton>Upload and Manage Files</guibutton> button in ARS'
          Control Panel page to upload and delete files in your S3 bucket, or
          create new directories into it. When you are creating items in this
          category, make sure you select "File" from the type drop-down and
          after a few seconds you will see a list of your files stored on
          Amazon S3. And, yes, Amazon S3 integration works with Normal and
          Bleeding Edge categories alike!</para>

      <title>Creating front-end items</title>

      <para>A repository system is worth nothing if it can't be accessed from
      your site's visitors. ARS comes with ten different public layouts so
      that you can always present it the way you want. On top of that it uses
      Chameleon skinning. This is a technique originally developed by Stian
      Didriksen and used in the NinjaBoard forum component. Instead of
      providing you a huge CSS file you have to customize to make the
      component look good, Chameleon skinning uses module chrome to render its
      output. In other words, pieces of the pages generated by ARS look like
      Joomla! modules. Leveraging this technique allows you to quickly "skin"
      ARS to look beautiful on your site in less than 5 minutes, without
      writing a single line of CSS.</para>

        <para><bridgehead>Direct Link Options</bridgehead>ARS is excellent for
        distributing subscription-based software. However this requires the
        users to log in to your site, download the file to their device /
        computer and then use it. This is just fine when your users are using
        a full-blown computer, e.g. a desktop or a laptop. This doesn't really
        work when they are using a mobile device like a smartphone or a
        tablet. In those cases it would be much better if you could just give
        them a "pre-signed" URL which allows them to download the software
        directly, without having to log in. If you are in the business of
        distributing Joomla! extensions (like us) this direct link can be used
        with Joomla!'s "Install from URL" feature to allow your users to
        easily install the extension on their site.</para>

        <para>And that's exactly what the Direct Link is: a link (URL) which
        can be used with Joomla!'s "Install from URL" feature to install

        <para>Akeeba Release System comes bundled with content plugins which
        make your life easier. Content plugins can be used in all areas of
        Joomla! and its components which support content preparation, such as

        Release System itself (the descriptions support content plugins),
        Akeeba Subscriptions and so on.</para>

          <para>Shown in the plugin manager as: <guilabel>Content - Download
          ID</guilabel></para>

          <note>
            <para>This plugin only appeals to developers. If you are not a
            developer you don't need and you are not supposed to understand
            this part of the documentation. If you are not a developer, just
            disable this plugin.</para>
          </note>

          <para>If you want to provide updates to registered users /
          subscribers you will find out that the download URL in the XML and
          INI update streams results in a 403 Forbidden error. This is normal.
          These downloads are only available to registered users, but
          accessing the URL directly, from Joomla!'s perspective, is a guest
          (non logged in) visitor trying to access the URL. This of course
          results in a 403 Forbidden error and begs the question: how do you
          authenticate users?</para>

          <para>The answer to that question is the Download ID. The Download
          ID is an MD5 hash derived from a user's numeric ID, username,
          encrypted password and email address which uniquely identified the
          user to ARS. Appending the download URL with the
          dlid=<replaceable>download_id</replaceable> query string parameter
          will allow ARS to authenticate the user and, if he has access to the
          download, proceed with the download.</para>

          <para>You need to be able to communicate this Download ID to your
          users. This is where this plugin comes in use. Just enter
          <programlisting>{dlid}</programlisting>in an article, Custom HTML
          module or anywhere else where content plugins are supported. It will
          be replaced with the download ID of the current user, e.g.
          abcdef01234567890abcdef01234567890, or a blank string if the user is
          a guest.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Just because a Download ID is displayed for a user it
            doesn't mean that he has access to any downloads. Think of the
            Download ID as a combined, abbreviated form of a username and a
            password.</para>
          </important>

          <warning>
            <para>The Download ID changes whenever your user changes or resets
            his password, <emphasis>even if the his password is the same as
            the old one</emphasis>. This is a consequence of the very correct
            and secure way Joomla! handles password changes. Whenever a
            password is changed, Joomla! stores a new encrypted form of the
            password, based on a new random string, in the database. Since the
            Download ID algorithm uses the encrypted password as part of its
            calculation, the Download ID changes when Joomla! changes the
            stored encrypted password.</para>

          <para>Many times you want to include the latest published version
          number of a specific category in your content articles. Surely, you
          can just type it out. This works perfectly when you only do that in
          one or two places, provided that you remember to edit this
          information every single time you make a new release. However, after
          a while, it becomes too cumbersome. Especially when this information
          is present in more than two places and/or you have more than a
          handful of categories. This is where this plugin comes in to save
          your day. It allows you to automatically display the version number
          and URL of the latest release. Moreover, it allows you to link
          directly to specific items in the latest release of a
          category.</para>

          category (not the alias, the title). This will return the URL to
          latest release's version number, e.g. 1.0. Please note that this is
          the URL, not a link! If you want to use it as a link you will need
          something like this:</para>

          <programlisting>&lt;a href="{arslatest <emphasis role="bold">release_link</emphasis> <replaceable>Category Name</replaceable>}"&gt;Your link text&lt;/a&gt;</programlisting>

          <para>You can combine it with the version number syntax for

          <para>where Category Name is the name of the Akeeba Release System
          category and pattern is a file naming pattern, enclosed in double
          quotes. For example, in order to create a link to a download item
          for a file whose names begins with com_foobar and ends in .zip in
          the Foobar category you would have to do:</para>

          <programlisting>{arslatest item_link 'com_foobar*.zip' Foobar}</programlisting>

          <para>Please note that this is the URL, not a link! If you want to

          <para>Akeeba Live Update does not require using Akeeba Release
          System and does not require any third party software to be installed
          on your user's site. It integrates with your own component, it is
          distributed with your own component and is just a bunch of files
          placed in a directory of your own component. It has zero
          dependencies and works perfectly under Joomla! 1.5 and Joomla!
          1.6.</para>
        </note>

        <bridgehead>Including ALU in your component</bridgehead>

        <para>The first thing you need to include in your extension is the ALU
        library itself. After installing Akeeba Release System, go to your
        site's <filename>administrator/components/com_ars</filename> directory
        and copy the <filename>liveupdate</filename> directory to your
        extension's back-end directory. It's important not to name this
        directory differently. For example, if you have a component named
        com_foobar then the library must be installed in
        <filename>administrator/components/com_foobar/liveupdate</filename>.</para>

        <bridgehead>Configuring ALU</bridgehead>

        <para>ALU needs to know which extension it updates, where to look for
        updates and where to cache its information. You can do that by editing
        the
        <filename>administrator/components/com_foobar/liveupdate/config.php</filename>
        file. The variables you have to supply are the following:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>$_extensionName</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The folder name of your extension. In our example, that's
              <filename>com_foobar</filename>. ALU uses this information to
              automatically locate your extension's XML manifest file so that
              it can read the version number and release date of the installed
              copy of your extension to your user's site.</para>

        <bridgehead>Letting ALU handle the view=liveupdate
        requests</bridgehead>

        <para>ALU is designed to be able to handle requests to your
        component's view=liveupdate URLs. In order to do that, you have to
        open the main entry point file of your component and append four lines
        of boilerplate PHP code. For instance, if your component is named
        com_foobar, open
        <filename>administrator/components/com_foobar/foobar.php</filename>
        and paste the following lines right after the <code>defined('_JEXEC')
        or die();</code> statement.</para>

        <programlisting>require_once JPATH_COMPONENT_ADMINISTRATOR.DS.'liveupdate'.DS.'liveupdate.php';
if(JRequest::getCmd('view','') == 'liveupdate') {
    LiveUpdate::handleRequest();
    return;
}</programlisting>

        <para>These lines do the following:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>They load the ALU library.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>They check if the name of the view is liveupdate. You can
            use a different view name by editing the right hand side of the
            conditional check.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If the view matches, they hand off the execution to ALU. Do
            not forget the return statement! If you do, your component's
            controller will fire after ALU's integrated controller, wrecking
            havoc.</para>

        <bridgehead>Using ALU to create an update status Control Panel
        icon</bridgehead>

        <para>ALU has a shorthand function to create an icon div, useful for
        displaying the update status of your extension in your extension's
        Control Panel page. All you have to do is paste the following line in
        your layout file:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;?php echo LiveUpdate::getIcon(); ?&gt;</programlisting>

        <bridgehead>How ALU updates work</bridgehead>

        <para>The first step is to get your user to visit ALU's main page. If
        you followed the instructions above to the letter, this is done by
        redirecting your user to view=liveupdate of your component, e.g.
        <uri>index.php?option=com_foobar&amp;view=liveupdate</uri>.</para>

        <para>Live Update will then try to fetch the update information. It
        will first check its cache. If there are no cached data or if they are
        older than 6 hours, it will re-fetch the information from your server.
        If an update is found, it will notify the user. It will also notify
        the user if Live Update is not supported on his server (lack of cURL /
        URL fopen() wrappers or firewall disallowing connections to your
        update server) or if ALU determined that the last time it tried to
        fetch updates it crashed.</para>

        <para>If the user chooses to install a new version, the following will
        happen:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>ALU checks if the Joomla! FTP Layer is enabled but no
            username/password is supplied. In that case, it will ask your user
            to supply the FTP username and password.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The update package is fetched from your server and saved to
            your user's temporary directory. ALU will first try using cURL. If
            that fails, it will try using URL fopen() wrappers. If writing
            directly to the file is not possible, ALU will load the package in
            memory and use JFile::write() to write it to disk. If all else
            fails, your user will see an error messaging prompting him to
            enable Joomla!'s FTP layer.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The downloaded update package is extracted using Joomla!'s
            API. If that fails, your user is notified and the process stops. A
            failed extraction usually means that either your package is broken
            or your user's server doesn't allow downloading files
            correctly.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The extracted package is installed using Joomla!'s API, but
            without calling the com_installer component itself. Any
            post-installation tasks will run normally, so don't worry if you
            want to run AJAX calls as soon as your extension is
            installed.</para>

            <para>Without loading a different page, a hidden IFRAME will take
            care of cleaning up, i.e. remove the update package and its
            extracted files, just like com_installer would do.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>Since ALU performs these four steps in separate page loads it is
        much more resilient to server timeouts than Joomla!'s com_installer.
        More specifically, com_installer tries to run all four steps within
        the same page load. If your client is using Joomla!'s FTP layer this
        takes forever and causes a White Screen Of Death due to timeout or
        memory errors. ALU separates and isolates those steps, avoiding such
        issues even with extremely large installation packages (in the range
        of 2-4Mb!). Moreover, it provides intelligent error messages where it
        can instead of the cryptic com_installer messages, where "Package not
        found" may mean "I could not download the file"...</para>

        <bridgehead>Allowing your user to upgrade extensions with restricted
        downloads</bridgehead>

        <para>Some developers want to provide downloads that are not openly
        accessible to the public. For instance, downloading a file may require
        registering for a free account and logging in before it is available.
        Developers distributing their software for a fee have a similar
        condition to face: they need only their subscribers to be able to
        download their software. The common ground in all of those cases is
        that you actually need to log in the user before downloading the
        file.</para>

        <para>ALU, when consuming the update feed of an ARS installation, can
        cater for that. How? If you set the $_requiresAuthorization to true,
        ALU knows that your site requires authorization before downloading a
        backup archive. In order to achieve that, it will append a
        username/password pair or a unique per user Download ID to the
        download URL. Akeeba Release System on your site sees that information
        and tries to authenticate the user. If the authentication succeeds, it
        will continue with the download.</para>

        <para>The remaining question is how ALU knows what the
        username/password pair or the download ID is. The answer is simple.
        All you have to do is to create component parameters in your
        component's config.xml file. If you want to use username/password
        pairs, add the following lines after your &lt;params&gt; tag:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;param name="username" type="text" default="" size="30"
label="Username"
description ="Enter the username to our site in order to enable Live Updates" /&gt;
&lt;param name="password" type="text" default="" size="30"
label="Password"
description ="Enter the password to our site in order to enable Live Updates" /&gt;
</programlisting>

        <para>If you have a Joomla! 1.6 component replace &lt;param&gt; with
        &lt;field&gt;. Similarly, in order to use a Download ID use
        this:</para>

        <programlisting>&lt;param name="downloadid" type="text" default="" size="30"
label="Download ID"
description ="Enter your Download ID to enable Live Updates" /&gt;</programlisting>

        <para>Alternatively, you can override the LiveUpdateConfig class'
        constructor and populate the $_username/$_password or $_downloadID
        parameters during the class initialization.</para>

        <bridgehead>Do I need to pay anything / install your software on my
        users' site / sell my soul to the devil to use ALU?</bridgehead>

        <para>No, absolutely not! We provide ALU free of charge and royalty
        free. It's license (GNU LGPL 3 or later) allows you to use ALU on Open
        Source and Proprietary components alike. You set up ALU to consume an
        ARS-provided INI update stream or you can supply your own INI update
        stream. There are no per-requisites and no strings attached. We have
        created ALU because we needed it for our own use. We give it away to
        the world so that all extensions can provide the smooth
        one-click-and-you're-up-to-date experience that made us famous.</para>

        <para>We kindly ask, however, to not remove the link back to us on the
        bottom of ALU's pages. While you can legally do that (we can't and
        won't prevent you from doing so) we consider it professional courtesy
        to give us credit for our hard work. We also kindly ask you to submit
        any patches, fixes, additions or observations back to us. ALU is Free
        Software and as such it is powered by the worldwide Joomla! community.
        Any and all improvements to ALU have a positive impact to thousands of
        users.</para>

        <title>How the BleedingEdge categories work</title>

        <para>BleedingEdge (BE) categories are quite different than the
        Normal-type categories. You don't have to visit your site's back-end
        to publish and unpublish releases and items. It all happens
        automatically whenever you upload or delete files on your server. Here
        is the breakdown of how that works.</para>

        <para>As all ARS categories, BleedingEdge categories are linked with a
        Files Directory. Unlike Normal-type categories, BE categories
        continuously monitor that directory for changes. Whenever you create a
        new subdirectory, a new ARS Release is created. The Version of the ARS
        Release is the directory's name and its Maturity is always set to
        "Alpha". Here is the coolness factor for software releases: If you
        upload a plain text file named CHANGELOG (yes, all caps and no
        extension), ARS will read it, compare it with the previous releases's
        CHANGELOG, colorize the result and use that as the ARS Release's
        description. The colorizer follows the Joomla! standard on marking
        changes in the CHANGELOG:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Lines starting with # (hash) indicate bug fixes</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Lines starting with ~ (tilde) indicate miscellaneous
            changes</para>

            <para>All other lines are comments and/or notes</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>If you're not interested in colorizing, changelogs and stuff
        like that, just keep in mind that if you upload a plain text file
        named CHANGELOG it will be used as your ARS Release's
        description.</para>

        <para>Finally, for each file you upload an item be created and
        published. If you have set up Automatic Item Descriptions for the
        category they will, of course, be used for naming the file. ARS
        Releases and ARS Items created this way will inherit the access (view)
        level and AMBRA Group settings of the BE category.</para>

        <title>Updating the MaxMind GeoIP database</title>

        <note>
          <para>This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind,
          available from http://www.maxmind.com/.</para>
        </note>

        <para>Akeeba Release System uses the free MaxMind's GeoLite Country
        database for determining the country of origin of users downloading
        your items. More specifically, it uses the GeoLite Country database
        file. This file is updated very frequently, about once every month.
        You can download its latest version <link
        xlink:href="http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">directly from MaxMind's
        website</link>. Why do that? IP assignments to countries change all
        the time. By the time we release our software, the database file is
        most likely already stale. This could cause some IP addresses to be
        identified as coming from the wrong country. Updating the file
        regularly will give you much better accuracy in the country
        statistics. Do note that MaxMind claims an accuracy of 99.5% for its
        free GeoLite Country database. This means that some IP addresses may
        still be reported as belonging to the wrong country. Furthermore, IPv6
        is not supported yet.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>If you are a subscriber to MaxMind's more accurate (99.8%
          advertised accuracy), for-a-fee GeoIP Country database you can use
          that database instead of the free GeoLite database included in the
          component, using the same procedure.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>The file you download is a compressed file, named GeoIP.dat.gz.
        You have to uncompress it first, using gunzip (Linux), or your
        favourite archive file application such as 7-Zip, WinZIP, PKZIP for
        Windows, BetterZIP, etc. This will result to an uncompressed file
        named GeoIP.dat. Upload that file to the
        <filename>administrator/components/com_ars/assets/geoip</filename>
        directory of your site.</para>

        <important>
          <para>If you are on Linux hosting (most likely you are) lower and
          upper case letters do matter! The file must be named exactly
          <filename>GeoIP.dat</filename>. Other names, such as
          <filename>Geoip.dat</filename>, <filename>GEOIP.DAT</filename> or
          <filename>geoip.dat</filename> will not work.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Do note that download log records prior to installing the new
        version of the database will not be affected. Only download attempts
        logged after uploading the new database version will be affected by
        the new database version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">0. PREAMBLE</bridgehead>

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
      assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
      to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
      works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
      complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
      designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">1. APPLICABILITY AND
      DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
      that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
      work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
      to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
      is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
      distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
      law.</para>

      <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
      a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
      them.</para>

      <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
      section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
      allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
      Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
      is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
      such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
      section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
      3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
      under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
      release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
      distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
          version if the original publisher of that version gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
          Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
          authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
          fewer than five), unless they release you from this
          requirement.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the

          <simpara>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its
          Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
          Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document,
          create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
          Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
          Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
          Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
          and likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
          "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that
          was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
          the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in
          the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
      appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
      copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
      of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
      of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
      been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
      and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
      Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
      arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
      cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
      made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
      License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
      assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
      this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
      copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
      different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
      in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
      Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
      "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
      delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
      documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
      License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</para>

      <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
      copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
      License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
      document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</bridgehead>

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
      separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
      the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
      that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
      equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
      they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

      <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
      Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
      the original English version of this License and the original versions
      of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
      disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

      <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
      Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
      title.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
      except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</bridgehead>

      <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
      the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns. See <link
      xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/"
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

      <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
      this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
      of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
      documents</bridgehead>

      <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
      of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
      license notices just after the title page:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

        <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
        document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
        Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
        Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
        entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
      Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.</para>

      <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
      their use in free software.</para>

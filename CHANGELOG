Version 0.2 (Current trunk)
================================================================================
!! HACK: The frontent/views/update/tmpl/stream.php FORCES the type to be "component". I have to deal with that.
+ Added update INI and XML URLs to the update stream page
+ Added "Import from FRS" toolbar link to Items and Categories page
+ New items remember the Release set in the list pages's filter
+ New releases remember the Category set in the list pages's filter
# Notice thrown in Control Panel due to missing entry (today's downloads)
# Authentication against a Download ID wouldn't work
# No view except the Control Panel would load in Joomla! 1.6 RC1 or later
# Tokens were missing throughout the application
# Text filters were not escaped (potential XSS attack vector)
# Year statistics do not take the year into account (2011 stats show 2010 downloads)
# The currently selected file doesn't appear on copied entries with a type of File
# Files already used in other releases of the same category would appear when editing or creating an item
# Using the Download Log filters would cause a terrible lag when having several hundred thousands of log items in the database table
# Published/unpublished icons in Download Log view not showing in Joomla! 1.6
# Access, Published and Hits headers' JTEXT keys have changed in Joomla! 1.6
# If AMBRA.subs is not installed, some views crash and burn (e.g. category editor)
# Changing the access level from the list view should not be possible in Joomla! 1.6 due to the custom access levels
# Access level references in the tables and models where not valid for Joomla! 1.6
# Front-end was broken in Joomla! 1.6 due to API changes
# Broken router in Joomla! 1.6 as the new API doesn't return unpublished menu items
# Administrator lists didn't have zebra backgrounds making them very hard to read
# Pagination is wrong when filters are applied
# Item page: The alias MUST not be replaced if it's non-empty when the "Linked item URL" field is blurred.
# Item page: The "Linked item URL" field should be stripped of its query part before using it in the alias field

> You can edit releases even if the category is unpublished, unlike DOCman.

In order to manage the releases in ARS, just click on the Releases button on the Control Panel page, or the Releases link right below the component's name in any ARS page. A standard Joomla! administrator list page appears. Do note that the search box below the Title field will filter categories based on their title or description.

You can quickly make a copy of a release by selecting its checkbox on the left-hand column and clicking the Copy button on the toolbar. The items belonging to that release will be copied along. The copied release will be unpublished by default and have an ordering of 0. Deleting a release by selecting it and clicking on the Delete button will remove all items associated with that release. Beware! You will not be asked to confirm this choice. Deleting a release is an irreversible change. If you are not sure, unpublish instead of removing the release. You can edit a release either by clicking on its name (the Version column) in the list, or selecting it and clicking on the Edit button. You can add one or more new releases by clicking on the Newbutton. You can edit the category the release is in by clicking on the name of the category in the Category column.

**Editing or adding a release**

The release editor page consists of the following fields:

**Category**  
Choose the category where the release will be placed in.

> **Tip**
>
> If you had filtered the releases list based on a category, that category will be automatically selected in this box! Filter the list, save some time.

**Version**  
Type in the title of this release. Since ARS is optimised for software delivery, we call this field Version, but you may type in anything you want, not just numbers.

**Alias**  
This is the alias (slug) appended to the URL pointing to that release's page. It's best to keep it short and only use lowercase unaccented Latin letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), dashes and underscores. Anything else may behave oddly.

**Maturity**   
If you are using ARS for software distribution, select the maturity level of this release. The possible options are Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate and Stable.

**Hits**  
How many times the release page has been displayed. You can use this field to alter that number. Do note that you do not need to change it on copied releases; copies will automatically receive a Hits number of zero.

**Published**  
Should it be visible to your users? Set to off to hide the category from view.

**Access**  
The Joomla! access level / view level to apply to the release. You can create custom view levels, effectively choosing which user groups should be granted access.

**Description**   
Use the WYSIWYG editor to type in a description to be displayed for this release. You can use plugins freely.

Please note that if a release is unavailable to a particular user the user will not see the release listed in the front-end and will be unable to download its items.

Clicking on the Save & New button will save the release and immediately let you create a new category.

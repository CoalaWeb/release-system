Version 0.2 (Current trunk)
================================================================================
!! HACK: The frontent/views/update/tmpl/stream.php FORCES the type to be "component". I have to deal with that.
~ Improved log view when having hundreds of thousands of records (just don't try using the free text filters!)
# Notice thrown in Control Panel due to missing entry (today's downloads)
# Authentication against a Download ID wouldn't work
# No view except the Control Panel would load in Joomla! 1.6 RC1 or later
# Tokens were missing throughout the application
# Text filters were not escaped (potential XSS attack vector)

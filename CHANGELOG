Version 1.0
================================================================================

+ Adding ability for plugins to post-process downloads
# Category manager: you can add category without files directory (thank you @themexpert for the heads up)
# Release manager: if no maturity is specified, a SQL error occurs (thank you @themexpert for the heads up)
# PHP 5.3.3+ would throw an E_WARNING because Joomla! doesn't set the default timezone on systems where php.ini doesn't specify a timezone setting
# Latest Release page didn't use the Chameleon styling engine
# Notices thrown accessing a Category or Release when there is no menu item to a parent ARS view on your site
# Could not download file if a menu item pointing to ARS wasn't present on the site
# Downloading files failed when Admin Tools' Geoblocking was active
# Anti-leech protection caused a PHP notice to be thrown
# Extra slash in the download URLs in update INI files (thank you deros)

Live Update:
# The component storage class was broken
# Updating was impossible on servers lying about their cURL support status

<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Workaround for CLI scripts</strong>. Joomla! 3.4.7 introduced a major bug which made it impossible for
    third party CLI scripts, used in CRON jobs, to complete successfully. Unfortunately it also affected the CLI scripts
    of our own software. This release applies a workaround which lets the CLI scripts execute without a problem.

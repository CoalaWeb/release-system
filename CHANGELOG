Version 1.0
================================================================================

# Category manager: you can add category without files directory (thank you @themexpert for the heads up)
# Release manager: if no maturity is specified, a SQL error occurs (thank you @themexpert for the heads up)
# PHP 5.3.3+ would throw an E_WARNING because Joomla! doesn't set the default timezone on systems where php.ini doesn't specify a timezone setting
~ Added Norwegian translation

Live Update:
# The component storage class was broken
# Updating was impossible on servers lying about their cURL support status

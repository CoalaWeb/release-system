ARS comes with an integrated system to handle file uploads, manage files and create sub-directories. It is accessible from ARS Control Panel page by clicking on the Upload and Manage Files button.

When you launch that feature, it asks you to select a category. Select a category from the drop-down. This step is required for ARS to know which directory it should operate on. Remember that each category is linked with one Files Directory. Upon selecting a category, the page reloads with the full interface.

Right below the category selection area you will find two panes. The left hand pane contains a list of folders. You can create a new folder by typing a name in the box and clicking on the New folder button. Do note that the Joomla! API will convert dots and spaces to underscores and turn everything to lowercase characters. You can click on any directory to go "inside" it. The right hand pane contains a list of file. The name and size of each file is displayed. Click on the trashcan icon to delete the file.

> **Warning**
>
> ARS will not check if the file you delete belongs to an active item. It is perfectly possible that you end up deleting a file used by an active item, causing problems to users who try to download that item.

The bottom part of the page is the upload form. It uses Joomla!'s upload feature. Do note that your file will be uploaded to the the directory you are currently viewing.

> **Important**
>
> You can only upload one file at a time
